# Alpha-Zero-Connect4
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Project that trains a Neural Network to play Connect 4 

Connect 4 is a game in which two players take turns dropping colored coins in vertical shafts. 
A player wins when four of their coins form a line either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The goal of this project was to get a model to play the game intelligently and competitively.

This uses the AlphaZero training algorithm to train the neural network through self-play. 

The Connect 4 game was built and optimized for storage and retrieval during training, and
the trained model can be compressed and compiled into a ".py" file to be used for actual play (formatted for Kaggle's ConnectX environment).
